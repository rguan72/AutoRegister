## AutoRegister

This is an application for automatically registering for Winter 2019 UMich classes.

## Preparation - Usage

To prepare for auto register to work, backpack the classes you plan to take, and make sure you have Google Chrome installed. That's it!

## Running

Run the python script in terminal
`(virtualenv)$ python rg.py`
and select "install dependencies" if this is your first time using the product. Otherwise, select "Run Early" if you want the script to wait for your registration date to run. Select "Run Now" if you want the script to register for your classes now. You will be prompted to enter your umich uniqname and password.

## TODO

Create an .exe (or equivalent for mac) executable.

## Development

Clone the repo, create a virtual environment, and install dependencies. From there, you are ready to contribute!
